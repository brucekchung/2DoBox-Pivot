# Module 1 Ideabox:

Our task was to recreate an Ideabox comp and the following functionality:

* A user can submit idea with a title and description.
* A user's ideas will display in a list in the UI.
* A user can edit and delete those ideas and have their changes persist in local storage, even upon refresh.
* A user can up and down vote the quality of their idea.
* A user can search in real time their idea list.

We were able to build out this functionality. Our app is also responsive.

# Things that make us proud:

* We're proud of how we've preserved the comp's integrity.
* We're proud that we built out our local storage using JSON and JS objects (and not arrays).
* Of how much we've learned working together.

# Things to improve in the next iteration

* We have some small UI changes that move beyond the comp - for instance having the user-input form remain sticky when the user scrolls and the user-input submit upon enter/return.
* We'd like ideas to sort by quality automatically.
* We'd like to DRY up more of our jQuery, especially in our event listeners.

# Questions we still have:

* When should we strive for global vs local variables and where do you start losing your return on perfomance investment?
* Should we truncate longer cards and when should we use webkits to do so?
* When would our performance have been improved by using an array in local storage?
* How do we implement modular scroll functionality and sticky nav? It seems really complicated...
* How would a user clear the local storage?
* Should you alphabetize functions in your JS file sections?
* We found ourselves debating ids vs. classes often... when should uses classes in event bubbling?
